This project is the solution to a problem I was given as part of the interview process for a position I applied for.
It is not the original solution I submitted, I have refined it since then.

The problem was:

	You are given a binary file called “points” containing 10 million points (x,y). Each point is encoded
	as two successive 16 bit signed integer values.	

	Implement a Java program that computes
		- The 10 closest points to (-200,300)
		- The 20 furthest points from (1000, 25)
